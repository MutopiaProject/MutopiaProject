<h4>Historical Notes</h4>

<p>Benjamin Blake (born 22 February 1751, in Hackney (London), Died in
London 1827) was an English violinist, viola player and composer. Most
of what is known about him comes from information he supplied for
Sainsbury’s dictionary in 1824.  As a boy he was taught the violin by
Antonín Kammel, and later by Wilhelm Cramer, leader of the Italian
Opera orchestra at the King’s Theatre. Blake himself played the violin
in this orchestra from about 1775, and also at the Concert of Ancient
Music. He came into public prominence however as a viola player. He
was principal and soloist at the Professional Concert from 1785 to
1793, appearing regularly in string quartets with Cramer. He also
played the viola at the Prince of Wales’s musical evenings, and his
unusual interest in this instrument led to his publishing 18 duos for
violin and viola in the 1780s. After the 1793 season Blake resigned
from public performance. He was already studying the piano under
Clementi to equip himself as a teacher, and though he continued to
play the viola for the Prince of Wales he lived almost entirely by
teaching until 1820 when he retired. Some of his duos merit revival,
as also his sonatas for violin and piano, which were published in
score and show an interesting taste for minor keys; the violin parts
are called ‘accompaniments’ on the title page, but wrongly.</p>
