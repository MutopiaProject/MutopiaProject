The Mutopia Project
===================

The Mutopia Project offers sheet music based on editions in the public
domain. All sheet music is written in `LilyPond
<http://lilypond.org>`_ by volunteers and the entire archive is openly
available for download. If you are new to the project please visit
`MutopiaProject.org <http://mutopiaproject.org>`_ and browse the sheet music.

This GITHUB repository is made available to promote this volunteer
effort. There is a
`wiki <https://github.com/chrissawer/The-Mutopia-Project/wiki>`_
available if you are interested in contributing using GITHUB.
Please see the main website
`contribution page <http://www.mutopiaproject.org/contribute.html>`_ for
information on how to submit by email if you are not comfortable with GITHUB.
