The guitar continuo in this Mutopia edition was freely
adapted from a public domain  IMSLP edition edited by 
Alexandre BÃ©on:
https://imslp.org/wiki/Trio_Sonata_in_G_major%2C_Op.2_No.12_(Loeillet%2C_John)

This is the 2nd installment in what I hope will be a
Mutopia collection of pieces for flute, violin, and guitar.
The 1st installment is a Boismortier trio:
